Project for Springboard Software Engineering BootCamp Cohort Jan 2022.
Completed 2/17/22

## Assignment
I was given a project that contained html elements and the beginnings of a js file.
I had to create and complete functions to access information from the API and return/display it to the webpage

## To do
The episodes are only for the first result. I need to either append the epsodes directly below the result
or add a click event to titles in order to get the episodes once clicked.
